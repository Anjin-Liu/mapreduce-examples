# 📝 Academic Paper Writing Guide

## 📌 Overview

This guide provides a structured approach to writing a high-quality academic paper, especially in technical and scientific domains. It is designed to help clearly articulate the **problem**, justify the **significance**, critically review existing **literature**, detail the **methodology**, and present **experimental** evidence to support your claims.

## 1. 🧠 Problem Statement and Research Motivation

### 🔍 Background Introduction

- **Define the Problem or Idea**

  - Clearly state the problem you are addressing or the innovative idea you are exploring.
  - Illustrate the context or real-world application where the problem/idea is relevant.

- **Value Proposition**

  - Explain why solving this problem or exploring this idea matters.
  - What are the potential impacts, applications, or scientific contributions?

- **Literature Context and Motivation**
  - Review how the existing literature addresses this issue:
    - If **solutions exist**: Why are they insufficient or inadequate?
    - If **no solution exists**: Why not? What are the blockers—complexity, oversight, technical limitations?

### ✅ Summary of the Proposed Solution

- **Hypothesis or Key Insight**

  - Briefly describe how your approach addresses the problem.
  - Present the core idea or principle behind your method.

- **Advancement Over Existing Work**

  - Highlight what differentiates your solution:
    - Higher accuracy?
    - Greater scalability?
    - Theoretical insight?
    - Practical deployment?

- **Contributions to the Community**
  - Enumerate your key contributions:
    - 📐 A new algorithm or model
    - 📊 A novel benchmark or dataset
    - 📚 A new theoretical framework or theorem
    - ⚙️ A reusable system, tool, or application

## 2. 📚 Literature Review

### 🧩 Overview of Existing Solutions

- Present an evolution of solutions to the problem over time.
- Identify the main paradigms or methodological approaches taken.

### 🏆 State-of-the-Art (SOTA)

- List and categorize current leading methods.
- Summarize associated benchmark datasets and standard evaluation practices.

### 📈 Comparative Analysis

- Provide a comparison table of key SOTA methods:

  - Advantages
  - Limitations
  - Underlying assumptions
  - Common architectural or algorithmic structures

- Discuss common **limitations** or gaps among current methods.

### 🔄 New Perspective

- Is there an unexplored angle or setup?
  - E.g., can the problem be formulated differently?
- Are current methods adaptable to new settings or constraints?
  - E.g., does a novel data format or real-time constraint introduce new requirements?

## 3. ⚙️ Methodology

### 🧮 Problem Definition

- Provide a **formal mathematical definition** of the problem.
  - Notation, objective functions, constraints.
  - Where applicable, show: `f_old(x) ≤ f_new(x)` or another clear comparative formulation.

### 📘 Theoretical Foundations

- Define relevant concepts or assumptions.
- State and **prove key theorems** (if applicable).
- Include any formal claims, lemmas, or hypotheses.

### 🧑‍💻 Algorithm Design

- Present algorithms in a clear, tabular or pseudocode format.
- Perform complexity analysis:
  - Time and space complexity
  - Best/worst/average case performance

### ⚠️ Assumptions and Limitations

- Clearly discuss any assumptions made (e.g., data distribution, computational resources).
- Acknowledge any inherent limitations of your method.

## 4. 🔬 Experiments

### 🧪 Experiment Setup

- **Baseline Comparisons**

  - List all competing methods and the rationale for their inclusion.
  - Include key hyperparameters for all methods.

- **Dataset Selection**

  - Justify the choice of datasets.
  - Mention source, size, domains, and relevance to the problem.

- **Implementation Details**
  - Describe the training and evaluation settings of your proposed method.

### 📊 Experiment Results

- **Ablation Study**

  - Show the contribution of individual components of your method.

- **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**

  - Analyze how sensitive your method is to parameter changes.

- **Findings and Hypothesis Validation**

  - Discuss how results support (or contradict) your initial hypothesis.

- **Statistical Significance**
  - Apply tests like **Friedman Test** and visualize with **Critical Difference (CD) Diagrams** to establish robust statistical comparisons.
